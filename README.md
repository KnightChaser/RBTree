## RBTree
An easy-to-understand RBTree(Red-Black Tree) implementation in pure C language without dependency.
This program can even visualize the currently formulated RBTree structure!
I tried to sufficiently add annotations within the code... I hope you will be helped!

### Preview
You'll have an interactive interface to play with a Red-Black Tree with integer key(`int`).

My implementation's `visualize` feature shows the tree left to right. Except for that, it can print the whole tree! >_<

### How to build
It's so simple. If you're a Linux user, just hit `make`.
```sh
make
```
